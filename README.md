# Vale-Git-Practice

Initial commit to main; generally not a workflow practice.

Demo for practice purposes for `add`, `commit`, `push`, `checkout` and `rebase` commands.

- Addition of the developer branch, occasionally called `dev`.
- Addition of `branch-1`. (this branch is designed to be merged back into developer, then released with main)
	- `branch-1` should include a diagram in order to show direction of git practice.

- Addition of `branch-2`. (The idea here is that this file will clash with a future `branch-3` changes, made independent of `branch-2`)
- Addition of `branch-3`. (this branch is independently worked on from developer alongside `branch-2`)
	- also corrects the description of the initial commit to main rather than `Master`(an old expression of the original main branch name)
	- also corrects Demo practice keywords.
	- now also successfully rebases from developer to align with branch-2 changes. (incorporating team change into `branch-3`, ready for merge into developer)
