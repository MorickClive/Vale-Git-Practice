# Vale-Git-Practice

Initial Commit to Master; generally not a workflow practice.

Demo for practice purposes for `add` and `push` commands.

- Addition of the developer branch, occasionally called `dev`.
- Addition of `branch-1`. (this branch is designed to be merged back into developer, then released with main)
	- `branch-1` should include a diagram in order to show direction of git practice.
